### A bit about the game
It is a game based on a narrator constantly commenting on the player's actions and being mean and spiteful to the player. The player has a range of possible interactions along the way from climbing to drawing and puzzles. Very often the game breaks the fourth wall. It also likes to lose the player in endless corridors or trick the player with false passages.

### Equipment
The game was tested on an Oculus Quest 2 connected to a personal computer.
